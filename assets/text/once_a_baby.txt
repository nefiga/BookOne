It was a hot August Sunday when my daddy was born. %His mommy and daddy were very excited! %He wasn't supposed to be born until September,_but my daddy is always in a hurry.%His
 daddy took his mommy to the hospital, but the nurse_said, "It's not time yet."Later that day his daddy took_his mommy to the hospital again. %This time the nurse said, "It's time,"
and the doctor said,_"It's a boy!" %His mommy and daddy were so happy they cried_and smiled at the same time. %They loved my daddy very much. He was little and_cute, but he didn't have
 any hair. %His mommy and daddy took lots of pictures because_he was growing fast, my daddy is always in a hurry. %They wanted to keep the pictures so they could remember_what he looked like
 when he was a baby. %He couldn't even talk or walk. He just laid there_and looked cute. %Sometimes he would drink milk, sleep or just look at_his mommy and daddy. They didn't mind._They loved
 him! %Pretty soon my daddy learned to roll over, and then he_learned to sit up. %One day he got his first tooth, and then he learned_to crawl. %Before his mommy and daddy knew it...he had more_teeth,
but he still didn't have any hair. %And one day he learned how to walk all by himself! %My daddy loved to play in the sand pile every day._His mommy would watch him  out the window. %Each morning at 11 a.m.
 my daddy took a nap. It didn't_matter what he was doing..even eating lunch. %My daddy ran everywhere he went because_my daddy is always in a hurry. %Pretty soon my daddy wasn't a baby anymore...because_he grew
into a little boy. And guess what? %He has red hair...just like me!
